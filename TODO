  refactor test lib
  try flatmaps instead of std::map
  separate interior and leaf nodes into their own DBs to reduce fragmentation caused by uneven-sized leaf nodes
    * also normalise interior node size
  method to copy a MemStore tree into LMDB
  sync
    bytesBudget
    docs, benchmarks
    sync to/from pruned trees
    optimisation: in reconcile, don't recurse into sub-trees we have already confirmed are complete
    ability to copy a shadow tree into LMDB, expanding witnesses

lib
  ! tests for diff and mergeProof
  ! exporting proof of 0 keys should return a root witness

  - proof suitable for deletion (uses witnessLeafs instead of witnesses where necessary)
    ? WitnessBranch
  - warn when exporting partial tree
  - de-dup trees using diff functionality

  ? changeable hash function
  ? compact tree to ensure nodeIds are sequential
  ? resource limits on proof sizes when verifying (setMaxProofCmds?)
