features
  method to copy a MemStore tree into LMDB, replacing witness with trees when possible
  pruning
    methods to perform pruning
    sync to/from pruned trees
  proofs suitable for deletion (uses witnessLeafs instead of witnesses where necessary)
    ? WitnessBranch: only advantage is it reduces needed strands by 1
  de-dup trees using diff functionality
  ? changeable hash function

docs
  graphs of sync benchmarks

bugs
  exporting proof of 0 keys should return a root witness
  in garbage collection, never collect the highest-ID node in the DB, to prevent ID re-use
  ? clean-up key/keyHash terminology
  ? resource limits on proof sizes when verifying (setMaxProofCmds?)

opt
  separate interior and leaf nodes into their own DBs to reduce fragmentation caused by uneven-sized leaf nodes
    normalise interior node size
  ? tree compaction to ensure nodeIds are sequential
  ? flatmaps instead of std::map, ie in the update change-set
  ? any benefit to sync.diff using finishedNodes

tests
  tests for diff and mergeProof
  refactor test lib, multiple files
  ability to run a single test/file during dev
