  refactor test lib
  try flatmaps instead of std::map, ie in the update change-set
  separate interior and leaf nodes into their own DBs to reduce fragmentation caused by uneven-sized leaf nodes
    * also normalise interior node size
  method to copy a MemStore tree into LMDB, replacing witness with trees when possible
  in garbage collection, never collect the highest-id node in the DB, to prevent ID re-use
  ? clean-up key/keyHash terminology
  sync
    sync to/from pruned trees
    ? can sync.diff method use finishedNodes as optimisation
    docs, benchmarks

lib
  ! tests for diff and mergeProof
  ! exporting proof of 0 keys should return a root witness

  - proof suitable for deletion (uses witnessLeafs instead of witnesses where necessary)
    ? WitnessBranch
  - warn when exporting partial tree
  - de-dup trees using diff functionality

  ? changeable hash function
  ? compact tree to ensure nodeIds are sequential
  ? resource limits on proof sizes when verifying (setMaxProofCmds?)
